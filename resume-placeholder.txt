RESUME PLACEHOLDER FILE

To add your actual resume to the portfolio website:

1. Replace this file with your actual resume PDF
2. Rename it to "resume.pdf"
3. Place it in the root directory of your portfolio (same level as index.html)

The website now includes:
- A "View Resume" button that opens the PDF in a new tab
- A "Download PDF" button that downloads the resume directly
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Beautiful styling that matches your portfolio theme

Both buttons are located in:
- The hero section on the home page (index.html)
- The profile card on the about page (about.html)

Make sure your resume PDF is:
- Named exactly "resume.pdf"
- Located in the root directory
- Under 10MB for optimal loading
- Properly formatted and professional

The buttons will automatically work once you add your resume.pdf file!
